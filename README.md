# CalcFlow

A Python package to simplify preparing and parsing quantum chemistry calculations, with no external dependencies. Provides a clean, Pythonic API for interacting with QChem, ORCA, and potentially other quantum chemistry software.

## Features

- **Program-Agnostic API**: Abstract away program-specific syntax with a consistent interface
- **Strongly Typed**: Comprehensive type hints and validation for safer code
- **Immutable Objects**: Dataclass-based with a fluent API for transparent, thread-safe state changes
- **Extensible Design**: Abstract base classes make it easy to add support for additional programs
- **No Dependencies**: Built entirely on Python standard library
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Prevent errors before they happen with rigorous validation of inputs
