## Documentation Maintenance:

When adding new files, functions, or classes to the `calcflow` library or its tests, please ensure this `structure.md` file is updated to reflect the changes. 

Additionally, create or update the corresponding documentation file within the `docs/` directory structure (e.g., `docs/calcflow/new_module.md`). Ensure the 

`mkdocstrings` identifier block (like `::: calcflow.module.submodule`) is correctly added or updated to automatically generate documentation from the source code docstrings, following the pattern shown in `docs/calcflow/core.md`.
